Qatar's income inequality ratioThis project is to analyze the approach/weights/rank/data of Global Gender Gap Rap of World Economic Forum, from year 2006 (the first issue) to 2018 (up-to-date).  

The GGGR has a number of issues, including but not limited to the following ones:

1) WE Forum's GGGI approach is lack of solid theoretical analysis about its sensitivity nor stability of the rank and score, unlike the UN's GDI and GII indice which have been extensively reviewed and formally analyzed (not perfect though).

2) The GGGI's weights are just related to standard deviation of each indicator instead of the significance, which raises huge cencern.

3) The weights are ridiculously fixed with the data/result in year 2006. We see radical changes for both ranks and scores if applying the dynamic weights each year. Many countries' ranks may change up to 100+.

4) The weights are grouped into 4 dimensions, but with equal weight for those dimensions, that is inconsistent with its original design, because each dimention has quite different standard deviations which, based on the original design principle, should be distinguished and treated differently

5) The indicators are problematically designed and collected. Some of the indicators are of certain redundacy, and the authencity and authority of those indicators are quite inbalanced.

6) The analytical result also proves the poor stability of this index: the rank of each country changed too much for not only the overall GGI, but also for each dimension and each indicator.

7) The result finally demonstrates very suspicious reliablity of the data collected and used in those GGGRs, for example, the ratio of professional and technical female workers in Jordan in 2014 jumps from 0.51 to 1 within just 1 year (from rank#111 to rank#1 in this indicator), similarly in Senegal's secondary education enrolment ratio in 2018, Qatar's income inequality ratio in 2017, Burundi's primary education enrolment raio in 2016, Swaziland's health life expectancy raio in 2015, Sri Lanka's tertiary education ratio in 2012, Korea's wage inequality ration in 2008... The reports are full of such weird data across all years.
