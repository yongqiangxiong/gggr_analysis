This project is to analyze the approach/weights/rank/data of Global Gender Gap Rap of World Economic Forum, from year 2006 (the first issue) to 2018 (up-to-date).  

The GGGR has a number of issues, including but not limited to the following ones:

1) WE Forum's GGGI approach is lack of solid theoretical analysis about its sensitivity nor stability of the rank and score, unlike the UN's GDI and GII indice which have been extensively reviewed and analyzed.

2) The weights are just related to standard deviation instead of the significance of each indicator. 

3) The weights are ridiculously fixed with the data/result in year 2006. We see radical changes for both ranks and scores if applying the dynamic weights each year. Many countries' ranks may change up to 100+.

4) The weights are grouped into 4 dimensions, but with equal weight for those dimensions, that is inconsistent with its original design, because each dimention has quite different standard deviations which, based on the original design principle, should be distinguished and treated differently

5) The indicators are problematically designed and collected. Some of the indicators are of certain redundacy, and the authencity and authority of those indicators are quite inbalanced.

6) The analytical result proves the poor stability of this index: the rank/score of each country changed too much for not only the overall GGI, but also for each dimension and each indicator.

7) The result also demonstrates very suspicious reliablity of the data collected and used in those GGGRs.
