This project is to analyze the approach/weights/rank/data of Global Gender Gap Rap of World Economic Forum, from year 2006 (the first issue) to 2018 (up-to-date).  

The GGGR has a number of issues, including but not limited to the following ones:

1) The approach is lack of solid theoretical analysis about its sensitivity nor stability of the rank and score.
2) The weights are just related to standard deviation instead of the significance of each indicator. 
3) The weights are ridiculously fixed with the data/result in year 2006. We see radical changes if applying the dynamic weights each year.
4) The weights are grouped into 4 dimensions, but with equal weight for those dimensions, that is inconsistent with its original design.
5) The rank/score of each country changed too much for not only the overall GGI, but also for each dimension and each indicator.
6) The analytical result demonstrates the poor stability of this index.
7) The result also shows very suspicious reliablity of the data collected and used in those GGGRs.
